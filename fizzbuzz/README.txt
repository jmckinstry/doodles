Just getting over some imposter syndrome here, and what better way than to fizzbuzz?

I'll do this in passes:
1: How fast can I do the stock problem?
2: How fast can I do an extended version of the stock problem? Let's say, start at any int, stop at any int, have a modifiable list of divisors and words to emit when they come up
3: Fastest I can get it? Smallest memory footprint?
4: What I'd consider valid production code

After completion, the times were as follows:
1:  4:59.57
2:  9:07.92
3: 23:33.71
4: 30:24.49
